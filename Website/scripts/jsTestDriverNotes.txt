ensure JSTESTDRIVER_HOME environment variable is set on windows system and points to directry where the jsTestDriver jar file is installed

from command line run -> java -jar %JSTESTDRIVER_HOME%\JstestDriver-1.3.4.b.jar --port 4224
this will show a message "Setting runner mode quiet"
DO NOT CLOSE!

open browser you want to test in - eg Firefox
visit localhost:4224 and select capture 
DO NOT CLOSE!

from command line, open at location of jsTestDriver.conf.
run -> jsTestDriver-1.3.4.b.jar --tests all

test scripts are refreshed every time, but the sources are not
add --reset to refresh the javascript sources under test.

This should show the test results.

Instead of registering a browser that stays open, pas one and it will be opened each time via command line, open at location of jsTestDriver.conf.
run -> jsTestDriver-1.3.4.b.jar --tests all  --browser "C:\Program Files (x86)\Mozilla Firefox\firefox.exe"

There are debug and verbose command line params to see whats going on, i.e. --verbose

-- Visual studio setup --
Reference: http://slmoloch.blogspot.co.uk/2009/08/how-to-run-jstestdriver-with-visual_02.html

* Add 2 external tools to visual studio, one to run the command to start jstestdriver along with extra params supplying which browsers 


== RUBY EXTENSION - continuos running and colours ==
# install ruby for windows
# install rubygems
# run > gem install gemcutter
# run > gem install jstdutil
# run > gem install win32console

Continous running use jsautotest - this looks for saves to the sources the config points at!
or run jstestdriver --tests all

options to run:
# command line window with colours - run > jsautotest
# add external tool running > C:\Ruby193\bin\jsautotest.bat  (output goes to vs console so no colours)
